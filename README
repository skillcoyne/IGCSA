TBD:

See hbase-genomes module.  At this time the software is developed to use HBase and Hadoop Map/Reduce. The flow is not currently automatic but should be run in this order:

 1. LoadFromFASTA - Takes all FASTA files from a genome (separated by chromosome), segments and inserts the segments into HBase.
 2. MutateFragments - This replaces FIGG. It uses the same Derby database with mutation sampling but writes new fragments to HBase instead of directly to file.
 3. HBaseKISS - Generates a random population of karyotype definitions based on breakpoint probabilities. All definitions loaded into HBase.
 4a. GenerateFullGenome - Outputs chromosome separated FASTA files for a given genome (not karyotype) name. This will either have been loaded in step (1) or generated through mutation in step (2).
 4b. GenerateDerivativeChromosomes - Outputs derivative chromosomes from karyotype definitions for a given karyotype (not genome) name. This is from definitions generated in step (3).
