To generate the database files for normal genome variation run the following in order.

Steps:

1. Download gvf files from Ensembl Homo_sapiens.gvf, all hapmap gvf files.
2. In the Ruby directory run read_ensembl.rb on Homo_sapies.gvf and read_hapmap_gvf.rb on the hapmap files.  Be sure to set the var.props files appropriately before each run or the resulting chromosome files will overwrite each other.
3. In the R directory run merge_chromosome_files.R
4. In the R directory run the ensembl_freq.R script for each chromosome.  
5. In the R/database_normal directory run the following in order:
	a. variation-table.R
  b. variation-probabilities.R
  c. generate-var-tables.R
  d. snv-prob.R

The result of those files are text files formatted for loading into the MySQL database.
